    <p id="par1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
        document written
        in a markup language.</p>
    <p id="par2">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work.
        It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p>
    <p id="par3">All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and
        layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins,
        borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
    <p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block: The selector points to the HTML element you want
        to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration
        includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
    <p id="par5">A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
        With CSS3, you can give any element "rounded corners", by using the border-radius property.</p>
    <p>With the CSS3 border-image property, you can set an image to be used as the border around an element.</p>
    <p>Flexible boxes, or flexbox, is a new layout mode in CSS3. Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably
        when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.</p>
    <p>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller
        on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the
        @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.</p>
    <p>The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.</p>
    <p>The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements. The margin properties set the size of the
        white space OUTSIDE the border.</p>
    <p>The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around content. The padding properties set the size of the
        white space between the element content and the element border.</p>
    <p>Creating transparent images with CSS is easy. The CSS opacity property is a part of the CSS3 recommendation. A
        pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.</p>
